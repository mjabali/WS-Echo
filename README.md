Simple WebSocket Server Endpoint Demo
=====================================


###Goal:
The goal of this demo is to demonstrate how you can get started with WebSockets in Oracle WebLogic 12c. 

###Version:
Developed and tested with Oracle WebLogic 12c (12.1.3.0.0)

###How to use it:
Download or clone this repo, deploy to your running instance of Oracle WebLogic 12c and navigate to http://hostname:port/WS_Echo/. Type a message in the text field on the page and then press the "Say Hello" button.
If everything works correctly, you should see a message below the button with the word Hello next to the text you have sent.
 
This demonstration can also be used together with a mobile frontend available here: https://github.com/mjabali/AsyncMsgDemo
